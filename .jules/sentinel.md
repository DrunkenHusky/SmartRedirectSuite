## 2024-05-24 - CSV Injection Vulnerability
**Vulnerability:** The `ImportExportService` generated CSV and Excel files without sanitizing fields (matcher, targetUrl, infoText). This allowed "Formula Injection" where a malicious user (or admin copying malicious input) could insert formulas (e.g., `=1+1`) that would execute when opened in Excel/Sheets.
**Learning:** Even internal admin-facing tools need sanitization, as admins might import/export data from untrusted sources or the application might be used in a way where "Info" fields are populated from user logs. CSV/Excel generation libraries often don't sanitize for formulas by default.
**Prevention:** Implemented a `sanitizeForCSV` helper that prepends a single quote `'` to any string starting with `=`, `+`, `-`, or `@`. Applied this to all text fields in CSV and Excel generation.
